Time is tricky.It is difficult to control and easy to waste more time than you need.For example,at the beginning of a semester,you may feel that you have plenty of time on you hands.But toward the end of the term you may suddenly find that time is running out.You don't have enough time to cover all your duties,so you get worried.What is the answer?Control!Time is dangerous.If you don't control it,it will control you.If you don't make it work for you,it will work against you.So you must become the master of time,not its servant.As a first-year college student,time management will be your number one problem.
